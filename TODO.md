PAYMENT:
  - when creating a pament session add user id to success_url so that it is possible to fetch transaction data for the user? -> use a uuid from nano that is added to the metadata and later added to db for easy fetching? -> when fetching for a transaction: if no user id use uuid?
      - ex -> adding the `payment_intent` and use it in the database then fetch it when on the thank you page?
      - this means that a transactions table has to be created in the database
        - if user is logged in add user_id to the transaction data, use later to filter all transactions for a user
