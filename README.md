# Prerequisites

Node version `18`  is required to run this project. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage node versions.

# Setup

```bash
  # set propper node version -> v18
  nvm use

  # install dependencies
  npm i
```

# TEST mode
By setting the test variable in the .env file to true you can run the app in offline mode. No need for stripe or mongodb connection.

```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST=true
```


# Getting Started

## In test mode

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST=true` in the env file to run the app in test mode.

Run the app locally without any internet connection. This is useful for testing and developing the app without the need for stripe or mongodb connection.

```bash

  # run dev server -> http://localhost:3000
  npm run dev

```

## In live mode

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST=false` in the env file to run the app in live mode.

The app connects to stripe, auth0 and mongodb

# fetching products from stripe

```javascript
  const url = 'https://api.stripe.com/v1/products?limit=3';
  const options = {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Basic ' + Buffer.from('sk_test_xxxxx:').toString('base64')
    }
  };
```

## Stripe cli

Installing the stripe cli: [https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)

Setting up the webhook in stripe dashboad: TODO:

```bash
  # Proxy for stripe webhook

  stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/payment-webhook

  # Listen for logs

  stripe logs tail


  # Trigger a test webhook not using app
  stripe trigger customer.subscription.created

```

## Payment flow
- user selects product
- user initiates payment (client) -> session is created on the server from a POST request from the client
  -> sessionStamp is added to success url and metadata
- client gets session id and redirects to checkout page from Stripe
- user completes payment on stripe
- user is redirected to thank you page
  -> transaction data is fetched based on the sessionStamp in the return url
    -> a 3 second timeout is added to the thank you page to make sure that the webhook has time to update the order on the user
- server gets webhook from stripe and updates order on user in the database
- user can see order in profile page



# Mongodb

TODO: how to set up mongodb
- login to mongodb
- get the app


```JavaScript
  // Connectiong to the mongodb
  import { connectToDatabase } from "@/utils/connectToDatabase";

  const { client } = await connectToDatabase();
  const db = client.db(`${process.env.MONGODB_CLIENT_DB}`);

  const collection = db.collection(
    `${process.env.MONGODB_CLIENT_COLLECTION_TRANSACTIONS}`
  );
```
