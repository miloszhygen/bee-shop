# Stripe
[DOC](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/pricing-table#embed)

TEST CARD: 4242424242424242

Stripe cli: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli

```
  # Proxy for stripe webhook

  stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/payment-webhook

  # Listen for logs

  stripe logs tail


  # Trigger a test webhook not using app
  stripe trigger customer.subscription.created

```

## Payment flow
- user selects product
- user initiates payment (client) -> session is created on the server from a POST request from the client 
  -> sessionStamp is added to success url and metadata 
- client gets session id and redirects to checkout page from Stripe
- user completes payment on stripe
- user is redirected to thank you page
  -> transaction data is fetched based on the sessionStamp in the return url
    -> a 3 second timeout is added to the thank you page to make sure that the webhook has time to update the order on the user 
- server gets webhook from stripe and updates order on user in the database
- user can see order in profile page


# Mongodb


```JavaScript
  // Connectiong to the mongodb
  import { connectToDatabase } from "@/utils/connectToDatabase";

  const { client } = await connectToDatabase();
  const db = client.db(`${process.env.MONGODB_CLIENT_DB}`);

  const collection = db.collection(
    `${process.env.MONGODB_CLIENT_COLLECTION_TRANSACTIONS}`
  );
```
