      </ul>
      <h2>Conformance status</h2>
      <p>
        The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for
        designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with

        and Level AAA. Our website is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level
        AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not
        fully conform to the accessibility standard.
